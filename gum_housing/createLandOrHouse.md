# Creating Houses and Interiors from Presets in the Game

## Simplest Part:

1) Open the book (by default, it’s the item "Build_Book").

### Description:

- The first page with the "?" icon is for creating a house already present in the game, such as MLO (Map Loading Objects), Sheriff's Station, and others. This is used to register these types of houses.
  
- The last page with the "?" icon is for land only. For example, if you only need land and don’t want to build a house, use this.

- Intermediate pages are houses that are included in the presets.

### Steps:

1. Select the desired house or land by opening the book and selecting the appropriate page.
   
2. Choose one option and click the "Build" button.
   
3. Place the house or land using the keys on the left side of the screen.
   
4. Click the left mouse button to begin defining the polygonal plot of land. Stand in the spot where the plot should begin, and then click around the perimeter of the land to mark it.

5. Right-click to finish the plot, and then set it according to the preset preferences. Once done, the house or land is ready for construction.

### The Same Process for Interiors:

The process for interiors is identical, with only one difference:

- Before pressing the "BUILD" button, **YOU MUST BE STANDING AT THE LOCATION WHERE THE TELEPORT TO THE INTERIOR WILL BE**.
